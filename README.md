# My Personal Portfolio | Project1_2022

I created this portfolio for myself to showcase that I have enough knowledge in frontend development languages to begin my journey as a developer.
Although, I don't have an actual experience yet being a one, I willing to show that I am able to produce responsive website and well designed portfolio.

I choose to have a 1 pager website that uses scrollspy feature to navigate through Home, About and Contact. I will add an additional page as my portfolio to showcase my future projects.

I intent for this website to get a glimpse of who I am, my skills and how they are able to contact me if they are interested on working with me.
Users can use my website to get an idea on how they are able to start with their journey as a front end developer too.

## UX

My website is simple but has potential of additional features in future. I started with checking out templates through online and checked which I can get inspiration from w2c.com, getbootstrap.com, dribble.com and many more.
My color choices was from [Link](http://HappyHues.com .com)	and [Link](http://coolors.com). Finally, I have chosen 2 vibrant colors

* dark blue purple
* light purple pink
* blacks and whites for my fonts

For my framework, I mainly used Bootstrap and also used CSS for styling my elements. 
I still have more to learn about best practices especially with grid and flex. 

Added my photo in the center, to show my willingness to learn and positivity.
Added my the percentage of of knowledge of languages I learned during my studies.

If I would do this project again, I would like my styling to be in the css file and more cleaner and clearer comments.
I would like to also further explore my knowledge in positioning and a little bit of smooth animation while scrolling through.
