# My Personal Portfolio | Project1_2022

This portfolio is a demonstration of my skills in frontend development languages, which I have learned to start my career as a developer. I have not yet gained any professional experience, but I have created this portfolio to show that I can design and code responsive websites.

My website is a single-page application that uses the scrollspy feature to navigate between the Home, About and Contact sections. I plan to add another page for my future projects soon. I am taking a gradual and steady approach to learning and improving.

The purpose of this website is to introduce myself, my skills and my contact information to potential employers or clients. Visitors can also use my website as an inspiration for their own portfolios and their journeys as frontend developers.

## UX

My website is simple but has potential of additional features in future. I started with checking out templates through online and I got my inspiration from  [w3schools](http://w3schools.com), [Bootstrap v5](http://getbootstrap.com), [dribble](http://dribble.com) and many more.
My color choices was from [HappyHues](http://HappyHues.com)	and [Coolors](http://coolors.com). 
Finally, I have chosen 2 vibrant colors and 2 neutral colors.

### Vibrant colors:
* Darkblue 
  - this color creates calmness and slows metabolism which is widely used by popular social media sites such as Facebook & Twitter. The shade of blue may also signify my masculine traits and that For me, that means that I can work with different gender, culture and anyone. I say this because I was born in Philippines, spend my teenage years in the Middle East, back to the my home country and built my family in multicultural country, New Zealand. I can clearly see that this color represents who I am from my past.
* Light Purple
  - this color is represented by power, superiority and nobility. A sophisticated color that is always one of my favorites. I cannot not pick this color, it is flexible, it can me warm or cool. 
### Blacks & Whites for Font color
  - Although they are neutral colors, they are best compliments to any colors. Some says its an easy pick but for me, Less is more. Its expresses my professionalism through my works and subsequents projects.

### For my framework, I mainly used [Bootstrap v5](https://www.getbootstrap.info/) and also used CSS for styling some of the elements. 
I am well aware that I still have more to learn, especially with best practices especially with grid and flex. And I would love to be in a team that would help me grow. Added my photo in the center, to show my willingness to learn and positivity. Also, my the percentage of knowledge of languages I learned during my studies.

### If I would do this project again:
- I want my styling files to be consolidated into css file 
- To provide clearer comments on my coding.
- Explore my knowledge in positioning and a little bit of smooth animation while scrolling through.
- I will use Git and GitHub, oftern when making updates on my code and testing each feature when as I add them.

## User Stories

* As the owner, I want to showcase my potential as a newbie in the developer world.
* As a visitor, I want to know what is the website for and that I know immediately who owns it and why it was created.
* As a recruiter, I want to see clean and novice responsive website. Everything is placed accordingly and easy to navigate information required for a personal portfolio. Especially the skills that can be offered and contact details when I am ready to hire the personal that owns the portfolio.
* As a non-IT background visitor, I want to see simple and easy to understand and ensuring that it was a pleased to visit a personal portfolio.
* As a friend visitor, I want to see its future goals, past and present projects.

## Wireframes

I drew my wireframes from scratch. First, I've done my wireframes in multiple pages but since I am new and want to keep it simple I decided to do scrollspy. I initially coded it separately easier to understand and then along the way. I added sections for each page and put them all together.

**My First Wireframes**
