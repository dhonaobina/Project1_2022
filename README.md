# My Personal Portfolio | Project1_2022

I created this portfolio for myself to showcase that I have enough knowledge in frontend development languages to begin my journey as a developer.
Although, I don't have an actual experience yet being a one, I willing to show that I am able to produce responsive website and well designed portfolio.

I choose to have a 1 pager website that uses scrollspy feature to navigate through Home, About and Contact. I will add an additional page as my portfolio to showcase my future projects.

I intent for this website to get a glimpse of who I am, my skills and how they are able to contact me if they are interested on working with me.
Users can use my website to get an idea on how they are able to start with their journey as a front end developer too.

## UX

My website is simple but has potential of additional features in future. I started with checking out templates through online and checked which I can get inspiration from w3schools.com, getbootstrap.com, dribble.com and many more.
My color choices was from [Link](http://HappyHues.com .com)	and [Link](http://coolors.com). Finally, I have chosen 2 vibrant colors

* dark blue purple
* light purple pink
* blacks and whites for my fonts

For my framework, I mainly used Bootstrap and also used CSS for styling my elements. 
I still have more to learn about best practices especially with grid and flex. 

Added my photo in the center, to show my willingness to learn and positivity.
Added my the percentage of of knowledge of languages I learned during my studies.

If I would do this project again, I would like my styling consolidated into css file for it to be more cleaner. Also have more clearer comments on my coding.
I would like need further explore my knowledge in positioning and a little bit of smooth animation while scrolling through.
I will use Git and GitHub when making updates on my code and testing each feature I add.

## User Stories

* As the owner, I want to showcase my potential as a newbie in the developer world.
* As a visitor, I want to know what is the website for and that I know immediately who owns it and why it was created.
* As a recruiter, I want to see clean and novice responsive website. Everything is placed accordingly and easy to navigate information required for a personal portfolio. Especially the skills that can be offered and contact details when I am ready to hire the personal that owns the portfolio.
* As a non-IT background vistor, I want to see simple and easy to understand and ensuring that it was a pleased to visit a personal portfolio.
* As a friend visitor, I want to see its future goals, past and present projects.


## Wireframes

I drew my wireframes from scratch. First, I've done my wireframes in multiple pages but since I am new and want to keep it simple I decided to do scrollspy. I initially coded it separately easier to understand and then along the way. I added sections for each page and put them all together.

**My First Wireframes**
